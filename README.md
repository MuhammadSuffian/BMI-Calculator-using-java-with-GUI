<h2>BMI Calculator:</h2> A based Java GUI Application for Body Mass Index (BMI) Calculation
<br><br>
This BMI Calculator is a comprehensive Java application with a graphical user interface (GUI) that allows users to calculate their BMI based on weight and height inputs. The program supports both pounds and kilograms for weight, as well as millimeters and feet/inches for height, providing flexibility for user preferences.
<br><br>
The GUI provides a user-friendly interface, featuring input fields for weight and height, along with a "Calculate" button to trigger the BMI calculation. The application includes conversion functions to ensure consistent units for weight and height, allowing accurate calculations.
<br><br>
Once the BMI is calculated using the formula: BMI = weight (kg) / (height (m))^2, the result is displayed on the GUI, along with an interpretation of the BMI category. This helps users understand whether they fall under the underweight, normal weight, overweight, or obese range, providing valuable insights into their health status.
<br><br>
The program also incorporates error handling and validation mechanisms to ensure valid user input, preventing any unexpected errors or crashes. By leveraging the power of Java and its Swing library, this BMI Calculator offers a smooth and efficient user experience.
<br><br>
The BMI Calculator project on GitHub includes the complete source code, along with any necessary dependencies and documentation. It serves as a valuable resource for developers interested in understanding BMI calculations, GUI development in Java, and best practices for error handling and validation.
<br><br>
With its user-friendly interface, unit conversion support, BMI interpretation, and robust error handling, this BMI Calculator is an ideal tool for individuals, healthcare professionals, and developers seeking to explore BMI calculations in a Java GUI environment.
